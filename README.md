## WINDOWS
I don't use Linux anymore because the software that I need do not run on Linux. It's not working on wine and virtual machine (virtualbox), and I have trouble setting up KVM + passthrough. I might come back to Linux in the future (I hope not because I've been wasting too much time on this) . 

# dotfiles
My extremely minimal dotfiles for Arch Linux.
